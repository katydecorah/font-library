# Contributing

Each font family is stored as an object in [families.json](families.json). Each family has an array of tags.

You can edit [families.json](families.json) to add, edit, or improve tags. I recommend starting by tagging fonts that you often want to find for yourself &mdash; curate your own tag! It's likely that someone else will dig your collection.

You can also click [**Need tags**](https://fontlibrary.dev/?tag=need+tags) to show all fonts that haven't been tagged yet:

## Editing families.json

[Visit families.json](families.json)

- Each font should have no more than 5 tags.
- Avoid creating new tags that are similar to already established tags, instead consolidate or rename all similar tags if a different tag name is more intuitive.
- Avoid ambiguous names for tags; make the tag name intuitive (Would you use this tag to find font X?).
- A tag must be used by more than one font.

These guidelines are enforced by tests. You can run the tests locally by first running `npm ci` from the command line and then `npm test`. Alternatively, you can wait to create a pull request and the tests will run there.

## How to contribute

There are a few different ways to contribute, you can:

1. Edit from GitHub.com directly
2. Create a pull request
3. Create an issue

### 1. Edit from GitHub.com directly

Open up [families.json](https://github.com/katydecorah/font-library/blob/gh-pages/families.json) to start editing.

### 2. Create a pull request

You can **create a pull request** to edit tags or to add newly added Google fonts.

When creating a pull request, it's helpful to:

- Double check your tags and ask yourself if it's something that you would use to find fonts
- Provide a brief description of the tags you added or changed
- Edit tags in small batches (<20 edits) to help speed up the reviewing process
